# Military-Shop

Military-Shop is an online store dedicated to vendors who can sell their military objects such as rifles, equipment, or grenades. 

For the online store, I used the Python language for all its functionalities, except payment and order processing where I used it
JavaScript. The entire application was written in PyCharm. To create the store I used Python libraries such as JSON and Stripe to carry out the ordering process of the order. I used the PIL library to interpret and display the images.

Also, during the realization of the project, I used the Djnago web framework to develop the online store.

The applications that make up the project are the following:

• Core - this is the main application of the project where is stored the main template for the front page of the store.

• Store – in this application, all the functionalities of the cart are created: adding the product to the cart, deleting it, changing the quantity, viewing
the cart's total cost, the order's checkout function, and searching for a product. Also here in the store app is the product page with all its details, images, price, and description.

• User profile - this is the last app of the project where I created the functionalities for login, register, logout, viewing your profile, orders, and selling products if you are a vendor of this online store.

Database
----------
For the database of this project, I used DB SQLite3 for storing all my data of the store.

Front end
-----------
For the front end of the store, I used Django templates where I stored the HTML, Django template tags, and language.

*** The templates used in this project weren't created by me,  I just modified and adapted them for my vision of the store design. ***
